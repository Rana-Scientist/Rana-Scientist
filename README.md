<h3 align="left">Background:</h3>
• I am a dedicated and driven data scientist with a goal-oriented mindset and a "Can Do" attitude. I thrive on expanding my knowledge of new languages and cutting-edge technologies to enhance my strong programming background. With a Master's degree in data science as my foundation, I have achieved a series of notable certifications, including Machine Learning with SciKit Learn, Python Foundation, Data Science Tips and Tricks, AWS Academy Data Analytics, and Essential Trainings for Data Cleaning, SQL, Tableau, and Power-BI. These certifications have enriched my skills in data mining and analysis, with a focus on essential Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciKit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Boto3, and more. I bring over a year of hands-on experience, adeptly participating in ETL pipeline, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementing machine learning algorithms, and generating comprehensive reports. My versatile programming toolkit spans Python and SQL, and I am well-versed in tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Data Bricks, and VS code.
<br><br>
• Throughout my academic journey, I've adeptly navigated both supervised and unsupervised datasets, showcasing prowess in classification and regression techniques including Linear Regression, Simple Linear, Multi-Linear, and Polynomial Regression. My skillset encompasses a spectrum of machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), while my expertise in A/B Testing tailored insights for specific project contexts. Expanding my horizons, I've ventured into Sentiment Analysis using UCI and World Bank Datasets. For unsupervised analysis, I've honed proficiency in K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Market Basket Analysis, all bolstered by hands-on data visualization through Tableau in academic forecasting ventures.
<br><br>
• Earlier to this as a Unity 3D game developer, I spearheaded the creation of cutting-edge prototypes and custom Unity 3D plugins, while concurrently managing operations within the Google Play Store ecosystem. My technical contributions encompassed the development of highly optimized Unity 3D packages, seamlessly integrating UI components, core gameplay mechanics, sophisticated AI frameworks, in-app purchasing SDKs, and the seamless incorporation of platforms such as Admob and Unity to bolster analytics and social interactions. I harnessed Google Play Store and Unity Dashboard analytics to formulate data-driven strategies, dissecting metrics like active user engagement and retention rates.

<h3 align="left">Recent Work:</h3>
In my most recent role at Alqami, I was confronted with the challenge of streamlining supervised and unsupervised data validation and dynamic scoring processes, all while reducing the substantial time and resources dedicated to data-wrangling and scoring efforts without metadata. The core issue lies in the laborious data-wrangling efforts undertaken by data scientists or analysts, consuming a substantial 70 to 80% of their time and resources when preparing data sets for machine learning. Additionally, clients encountered difficulties locating suitable data sets aligned with their specific needs, often requiring meticulous considerations such as target audience, geographical coverage, timeliness, and historical relevance. Recognizing the need for an autonomous solution, I led the development of a Flask web-based application that seamlessly communicates with Python code. This application empowers both data providers and clients to independently validate data set health, resulting in an impressive 70-80% reduction in manual effort and development costs. By harnessing Alqami's algorithm, it dynamically scores supervised/unsupervised data, rapidly producing results without reliance on metadata. Encompassing Data Ingestion, Wrangling/Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and automated report generation, the Python-powered scoring effortlessly generates accessible scores through the web.
